"HBase can be found at this website: https://hbase.apache.org/. 
HBase is an open-source non-relational/noSQL database model. 
It uses a column-family data model and also has a distributed client/server hosting model. 
This means a cluster of machines work together to provide a fault-tolerant and scalable data store. 
Java can access HBase using the HBase Java API using the HBase Java Client, which provides a simple and consistent API for users to use. 
Python can access HBase using the HappyBase library. 
This information can be found at the HBase website and this source: https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#arch.overview."
