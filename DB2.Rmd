"DB2 is a commercial networked relational database (RDBM). It can be found at this website: https://www.ibm.com/analytics/db2. It is a relational data model and uses cloud-hosting, embedded, or client/server model. To access DB2 using Java or Python, you must first connect to DB2. Java can access DB2 using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), and Python can access using ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) drivers. IBM also provides specific libraries for Java and Python to interact with DB2. Java uses SQLJ and Python uses ibm_db. This information can be found at the DB2 website as well as this source: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5."
